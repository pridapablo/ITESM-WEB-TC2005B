<h1>a - Hyperlinks</h1>
    <p>
      The <a> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address. Content within each <a> should indicate the link's destination. If the href attribute is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the <a> element will activate it.

    <h1>p - Paragraphs</h1>
    <p>
      The &lt;p&gt;; HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields. Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing &lt;&sol;p&gt; tag.
    </&sol;p>
    <p>
      This is a paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.
    <!-- h1, h2, ... , h6 -->
    <h1>h1, h2, ... , h6 - Headings</h1>
    <p>
      The &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. &lt;h1&gt; is the highest section level and &lt;h6&gt; is the lowest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <h1>I am an h1 :)</h1>
    <h2>I am an h2</h2>
    <h3>I am an h3</h3>
    <h4>I am an h4</h4>
    <h5>I am an h5</h5>
    <h6>I am an h6</h6>
    <!-- div -->
    <h1>div - Division</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        The &lt;div&gt; HTML element is the generic container for 1flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>I'm a div</div>
    <!-- span -->
    <h1>span - Span</h1>
    <p>
      The &lt;span&gt; HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. &lt;span&gt; is very much like a &lt;div&gt; element, but &lt;div&gt; is a block-level element whereas a &lt;span&gt; is an inline element.
    </p>
    <span>This is a span example</span>
    <!-- strong -->
    <h1>strong - Strong</h1>
    <p>The &lt;strong&gt; HTML element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.</p>
    <strong>This is a strong example</strong>
    <!-- i -->
    <h1>i - Italic</h1>
    <p>The &lt;i&gt; HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the &lt;i&gt; naming of this element.</p>
    <i>This is an i example</i>
    <!-- u -->
    <h1>u - Unarticulated Annotation</h1>
    <p>The &lt;u&gt; HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS. Warning: This element used to be called the "Underline" element in older versions of HTML, and is still sometimes misused in this way. To underline text, you should instead apply a style that includes the CSS text-decoration property set to underline.</p>
    <u>This is an Unarticulated Annotation</u>
    <!-- b -->
    <h1>b - Bold</h1>
    <p>The &lt;b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use &lt;b> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the &lt;strong&gt; element.&lt;&sol;strong&gt;
    </p>
    <b>This is a b example</b>
    <!-- strike -->
    <h1>strike - Strike (Deprecated)</h1>
    <p>The &lt;strike&gt; HTML element places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.</p>
    <strike>Este es un ejemplo de un strike</strike>
    <!-- small -->
    <h1>small - Small</h1>
    <p>The &lt;small&gt; HTML element represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font-size smaller, such as from small to x-small.
    </p>
    <small>This text is super small</small>
    <!-- em -->
    <h1>em - Emphasis</h1>
    <p>The &lt;em&gt;: HTML element marks text that has stress emphasis. The &lt;em&gt; element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.</p>
    <em>This text is emphasized</em>
    <!-- header -->
    <h1>header - Header</h1>
    <p>The &lt;header&gt; HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</p>
    <header>
      <p>I'm a p inside of a header</p>
    </header>
    <!-- section -->
    <h1>section - Section</h1>
    <p>The &lt;section&gt; HTML element represents  a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>I'm a p inside of a section</p>
    </section>
    <!-- article -->
    <h1>article - Article</h1>
    <p>The &lt;article&gt; HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.
    </p>
    <article>
      <p>I'm a p inside of an article</p>
    </article>
    <!-- aside -->
    <h1>aside - Aside</h1>
    <p>The &lt;aside&gt; HTML element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>I'm a p inside of an aside, i should be on the side of the page</p>
    </aside>
    <!-- footer -->
    <h1>footer - Footer</h1>
    <p>The &lt;footer&gt; HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A <footer> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
    </p>
    <footer>
      <p>I'm a p inside of a footer, and i should be on the bottom of the page</p>
    </footer>
    <!-- nav -->
    <h1>nav - Navigation</h1>
    <p>The &lt;nav&gt; HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.
    </p>
    <nav>
      <p>I'm a p inside of a nav, and i should be at the top of the page</p>
    </nav>
    <!-- img -->
    <h1>img - Image</h1>
    <p>The &lt;img&gt; HTML element embeds an image into the document. This tag can have sources from different sources, such as a local file, or an external URL.
    </p>
    <img src="https://em-content.zobj.net/source/noto-emoji-animations/344/smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes_1f60a.gif" alt="A very happy smiling face" width="200" height="200">
    <!-- br -->
    <h1>br - Line Break</h1>
    <p>The &lt;br&gt; HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
      <br>
      <p>I'm a p before a br</p>
      <br>
      <p>I'm a p after a hr</p>

    </p>
    <!-- hr -->
    <h1>hr - Horizontal Rule</h1>
    <p>The &lt;hr&gt; HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.</p>
    <p>I'm a p before a hr</p>
    <hr>
    <p>I'm a p after a hr</p>
    <!-- form -->
    <h1>form - Form</h1>
    <p>The &lt;form&gt; HTML element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.</p>
    <form action="" method="get" class="form-example">
  <div class="form-example">
    <label for="name">Enter your name: </label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required>
  </div>
  <div class="form-example">
    <label for="email">Enter your email: </label>
    <input type="email" name="email" id="email" required>
  </div>
  <div class="form-example">
    <input type="submit" value="Subscribe!">
  </div>
</form>
    <!-- table -->
    <h1>table - Table</h1>
    <p>The &lt;table&gt; HTML element represents tabular data — that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>First Name</th>
        <th>Last Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
      </tr>

      </tr>
    </table>
