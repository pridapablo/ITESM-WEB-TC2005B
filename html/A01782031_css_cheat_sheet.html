      <div>
        <h1>Border</h1>
        <p>
          The border shorthand CSS property sets an element's border. It sets
          the values of border-width, border-style, and border-color.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>
          &lt;line-width&gt; Sets the thickness of the border. Defaults to
          medium if absent.
          <br />
          &lt;line-style&gt; Sets the style of the border. Defaults to none if
          absent.
          <br />
          &lt;color&gt; Sets the color of the border. Defaults to currentcolor
          if absent.

          The border-left shorthand CSS property sets all the properties of an
          element's left border. As with all shorthand properties, border-left
          always sets the values of all of the properties that it can set, even
          if they are not specified. It sets those that are not specified to
          their default values.
        </p>

          The border-right shorthand CSS property sets all the properties of an
          element's right border. As with all shorthand properties, border-right
          always sets the values of all of the properties that it can set, even
          if they are not specified. It sets those that are not specified to
          their default values.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        &lt;br-width&gt; Sets the thickness of the border. Defaults to medium if
        absent.

        <p>
          The border-top shorthand CSS property sets all the properties of an
          element's top border. As with all shorthand properties, border-top
          always sets the values of all of the properties that it can set, even
          if they are not specified. It sets those that are not specified to
          their default values.
        </p>
        <h2>Values</h2>
        &lt;br-width&gt; Sets the thickness of the border. Defaults to medium if
        absent.
        <br />
        &lt;br-style&gt; Sets the style of the border. Defaults to none if
        absent.
        <br />
        &lt;color&gt; Sets the color of the border. Defaults to currentcolor if
        absent.
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p id="border-top">i am a border-top</p>
      </div>
      <!-- border-bottom -->
      <div>
        <h1>Border Bottom</h1>
        <p>
          The border-bottom shorthand CSS property sets all the properties of an
          element's bottom border. As with all shorthand properties,
          border-bottom always sets the values of all of the properties that it
          can set, even if they are not specified. It sets those that are not
          specified to their default values.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        &lt;br-width&gt; Sets the thickness of the border. Defaults to medium if
        absent.
        <br />
        &lt;br-style&gt; Sets the style of the border. Defaults to none if
        absent.
        <br />

      </div>
      <!-- border-radius -->
      <div>
        <h1>Border Radius</h1>
        <p>
          The border-radius CSS property rounds the corners of an element's
          outer border edge. You can set a single radius to make circular
          corners, or two radii to make elliptical corners.
          <br />
          <br />
          The radius applies to the whole background, even if the element has no
          border; the exact position of the clipping is defined by the
          background-clip property.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        &lt;radius&gt; denoting a radius to use for the border in each corner of
        the border. It is used only in the one-value syntax. It can be a length
        or a percentage.
        <br />
        &lt;top-left-and-bottom-right&gt; denoting a radius to use for the
        border in the top-left and bottom-right corners of the element's box. It
        is used only in the two-value syntax. It can be a length or a
        percentage.
        <br />
        &lt;top-right-and-bottom-left&gt; denoting a radius to use for the
        border in the top-right and bottom-left corners of the element's box. It
        is used only in the two- and three-value syntaxes. It can be a length or
        a percentage.
        <br />
        &lt;top-left&gt; denoting a radius to use for the border in the top-left
        corner of the element's box. It is used in the three-value syntax or in
        the four-value syntax. It can be a length or a percentage.
        <br />
        &lt;top-right&gt; denoting a radius to use for the border in the
        top-right corner of the element's box. It is used in the four-value
        syntax. It can be a length or a percentage.
        <br />
        &lt;bottom-right&gt; denoting a radius to use for the border in the
        bottom-right corner of the element's box.It is used in the three-value
        syntax or in the four-value syntax. It can be a length or a percentage.
        <br />
        &lt;bottom-left&gt; denoting a radius to use for the border in the
        bottom-left corner of the element's box. It is used only in the
        four-value syntax. It can be a length or a percentage.

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p id="border-radius">i am a border-radius</p>
      </div>
      <!-- background-image -->
      <div>
        <h1>Background Image</h1>
        <p>
          The background-image CSS property sets one or more background images
          on an element.
          <br />
          The background images are drawn on stacking context layers on top of
          each other. The first layer specified is drawn as if it is closest to
          the user. The borders of the element are then drawn on top of them,
          and the background-color is drawn beneath them. How the images are
          drawn relative to the box and its borders is defined by the
          background-clip and background-origin CSS properties. If a specified
          image cannot be drawn (for example, when the file denoted by the
          specified URI cannot be loaded), browsers handle it as they would a
          none value.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>
          none: Is a keyword denoting the absence of images.
          <br />
          &lt;image&gt;: Is an &lt;image&gt; denoting the image to display.
          There can be several of them, separated by commas, as multiple
          backgrounds are supported.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p id="background-image">i am a background-image</p>
      </div>
      <!-- color -->
      <div>
        <h1>Color</h1>
        <p>
          The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's
          text and text decorations, and sets the currentcolor value.
          currentcolor may be used as an indirect value on other properties and
          is the default for other color properties, such as border-color.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            &lt;color&gt; Sets the color of the textual and decorative parts of
            the element.
          </li>
          <li>
            currentcolor Sets the color to the element's color property value.
            However, if set as the value of color, currentcolor is treated as
            inherit.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p id="color">i am a color</p>
      </div>
      <!-- font -->
      <div>
        <h1>Font</h1>
        <p>
          The font CSS shorthand property sets all the different properties of
          an element's font. Alternatively, it sets an element's font to a
          system font.
          <br />
          As with any shorthand property, any individual value that is not
          specified is set to its corresponding initial value (possibly
          overriding values previously set using non-shorthand properties).
          Though not directly settable by font, the longhands font-size-adjust
          and font-kerning are also reset to their initial values.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;'font-style'&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;'font-variant'&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;'font-weight'&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;'font-stretch'&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;'font-size'&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;'line-height'&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;'font-family'&gt;</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p id="font">i am an Arial font</p>
      </div>
      <!-- font-family -->
      <div>
        <h1>Font Family</h1>
        <p>
          The font-family CSS property specifies a prioritized list of one or
          more font family names and/or generic family names for the selected
          element. Values are separated by commas to indicate that they are
          alternatives. The browser will select the first font in the list that
          is installed or that can be downloaded using a @font-face at-rule. It
          is often convenient to use the shorthand property font to set
          font-size and other font related properties all at once. You should
          always include at least one generic family name in a font-family list,
          since there's no guarantee that any given font is available. This lets
          the browser select an acceptable fallback font when necessary.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            &lt;family-name&gt; The name of a font family. For example, "Times"
            and "Helvetica" are font families. Font family names containing
            whitespace should be quoted. For example: "Comic Sans MS".
          </li>

          <li>
            &lt;generic-name&gt; Generic font families are a fallback mechanism,
            a means of preserving some of the style sheet author's intent when
            none of the specified fonts are available. Generic family names are
            keywords and must not be quoted. A generic font family should be the
            last item in the list of font family names. The following keywords
            are defined:
            <ul>
              <li>
                serif Glyphs have finishing strokes, flared or tapering ends, or
                have actual serifed endings. For example: Lucida Bright, Lucida
                Fax, Palatino, Palatino Linotype, Palladio, URW Palladio, serif.
              </li>
              <li>
                sans-serif Glyphs have stroke endings that are plain. For
                example: Open Sans, Fira Sans, Lucida Sans, Lucida Sans Unicode,
                Trebuchet MS, Liberation Sans, Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif.
              </li>
              <li>
                monospace All glyphs have the same fixed width. For example:
                Fira Mono, DejaVu Sans Mono, Menlo, Consolas, Liberation Mono,
                Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace.
              </li>
              <li>
                cursive Glyphs in cursive fonts generally have either joining
                strokes or other cursive characteristics beyond those of italic
                typefaces. The glyphs are partially or completely connected, and
                the result looks more like handwritten pen or brush writing than
                printed letter work. For example: Brush Script MT, Brush Script
                Std, Lucida Calligraphy, Lucida Handwriting, Apple Chancery,
                cursive.
              </li>
              <li>
                fantasy Fantasy fonts are primarily decorative fonts that
                contain playful representations of characters. For example:
                Papyrus, Herculanum, Party LET, Curlz MT, Harrington, fantasy.
              </li>
              <li>
                system-ui Glyphs are taken from the default user interface font
                on a given platform. Because typographic traditions vary widely
                across the world, this generic is provided for typefaces that
                don't map cleanly into the other generics.
              </li>
              <li>ui-serif The default user interface serif font.</li>
              <li>ui-sans-serif The default user interface sans-serif font.</li>
              <li>ui-monospace The default user interface monospace font.</li>
              <li>
                ui-rounded The default user interface font that has rounded
                features.
              </li>
              <li>
                math This is for the particular stylistic concerns of
                representing mathematics: superscript and subscript, brackets
                that cross several lines, nesting expressions, and double struck
                glyphs with distinct meanings.
              </li>
              <li>
                emoji Fonts that are specifically designed to render emoji.
              </li>
              <li>
                fangsong A particular style of Chinese characters that are
                between serif-style Song and cursive-style Kai forms. This style
                is often used for government documents.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p id="font-family">i am a font-family</p>
      </div>
      <!-- font-style -->
      <div>
        <h1>Font Style</h1>
        <p>
          The font-style CSS property sets whether a font should be styled with
          a normal, italic, or oblique face from its font-family.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            normal Selects a font that is classified as normal within a
            font-family.
          </li>
          <li>
            italic Selects a font that is classified as italic. If no italic
            version of the face is available, one classified as oblique is used
            instead. If neither is available, the style is artificially
            simulated.
          </li>
          <li>
            oblique Selects a font that is classified as oblique. If no oblique
            version of the face is available, one classified as italic is used
            instead. If neither is available, the style is artificially
            simulated.
          </li>
          <li>
            oblique &lt;angle&gt; Selects a font classified as oblique, and
            additionally specifies an angle for the slant of the text. If one or
            more oblique faces are available in the chosen font family, the one
            that most closely matches the specified angle is chosen. If no
            oblique faces are available, the browser will synthesize an oblique
            version of the font by slanting a normal face by the specified
            amount. Valid values are degree values of -90deg to 90deg inclusive.
            If an angle is not specified, an angle of 14 degrees is used.
            Positive values are slanted to the end of the line, while negative
            values are slanted towards the beginning. In general, for a
            requested angle of 14 degrees or greater, larger angles are
            preferred; otherwise, smaller angles are preferred (see the spec's
            font matching section for the precise algorithm).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p id="font-style">i am using an italics font-style</p>
      </div>
      <!-- font-weight -->
      <div>
        <h1>Font Weight</h1>
        <p>
          The font-weight CSS property sets the weight (or boldness) of the
          font. The weights available depend on the font-family that is
          currently set.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>normal Normal font weight. Same as 400.</li>
          <li>bold Bold font weight. Same as 700.</li>
          <li>
            lighter One relative font weight lighter than the parent element.
            Note that only four font weights are considered for relative weight
            calculation; see the Meaning of relative weights section below.
          </li>
          <li>
            bolder One relative font weight heavier than the parent element.
            Note that only four font weights are considered for relative weight
            calculation; see the Meaning of relative weights section below.
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;number&gt; A &lt;number&gt; value between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
            Higher numbers represent weights that are bolder than (or as bold
            as) lower numbers. Certain commonly used values correspond to common
            weight names, as described in the Common weight name mapping section
            below.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- width -->
      <div>
        <h1>Width</h1>
        <p>
          The width CSS property sets an element's width. By default, it sets
          the width of the content area, but if box-sizing is set to border-box,
          it sets the width of the border area.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h1>Height</h1>
        <p>
          The height CSS property specifies the height of an element. By
          default, the property defines the height of the content area. If
          box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the
          height of the border area.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h1>List Style</h1>
        <p>
          The list-style CSS shorthand property allows you to set all the list
          style properties at once.

      <!-- margin -->
      <div>
        <h1>Margin</h1>
        <p>
          The margin CSS shorthand property sets the margin area on all four
          sides of an element.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;length&gt; The size of the margin as a fixed value.</li>

          <li>
            &lt;percentage&gt; The size of the margin as a percentage, relative
            to the inline size (width in a horizontal language, defined by
            writing-mode) of the containing block.
          </li>
          <li>
            auto The browser selects a suitable margin to use. For example, in
            certain cases this value can be used to center an element.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p id="margin">i have a 50px margin</p>
      </div>
      <!-- padding -->
      <div>
        <h1>Padding</h1>
        <p>
          The padding CSS shorthand property sets the padding area on all four
          sides of an element at once. An element's padding area is the space
          between its content and its border.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;length&gt; The size of the padding as a fixed value.</li>
          <li>
            &lt;percentage&gt; The size of the padding as a percentage, relative
            to the inline size (width in a horizontal language, defined by
            writing-mode) of the containing block.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p id="padding">i am a a 50px padding</p>
      </div>
      <!-- overflow -->
      <div>
        <h1>Overflow</h1>
        <p>
          The overflow CSS shorthand property sets the desired behavior for an
          element's overflow — i.e. when an element's content is too big to fit
          in its block formatting context — in both directions.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            visible Content is not clipped and may be rendered outside the
            padding box.
          </li>
          <li>
            hidden Content is clipped if necessary to fit the padding box. No
            scrollbars are provided, and no support for allowing the user to
            scroll (such as by dragging or using a scroll wheel) is allowed. The
            content can be scrolled programmatically (for example, by setting
            the value of a property such as scrollLeft or the scrollTo()
            method), so the element is still a scroll container.
          </li>

          <li>
            clip Similar to hidden, the content is clipped to the element's
            padding box. The difference between clip and hidden is that the clip
            keyword also forbids all scrolling, including programmatic
            scrolling. The box is not a scroll container, and does not start a
            new formatting context. If you wish to start a new formatting
            context, you can use display: flow-root to do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            scroll Content is clipped if necessary to fit the padding box.
            Browsers always display scrollbars whether or not any content is
            actually clipped, preventing scrollbars from appearing or
            disappearing as content changes. Printers may still print
            overflowing content.
          </li>
          <li>
            auto Depends on the user agent. If content fits inside the padding
            box, it looks the same as visible, but still establishes a new block
            formatting context. Desktop browsers provide scrollbars if content
            overflows.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p id="overflow">i am a overflow</p>
      </div>
      <!-- display -->
      <div>
        <h1>Display</h1>
        <p>
          The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block
          or inline element and the layout used for its children, such as flow
          layout, grid or flex. Formally, the display property sets an element's
          inner and outer display types. The outer type sets an element's
          participation in flow layout; the inner type sets the layout of
          children. Some values of display are fully defined in their own
          individual specifications; for example the detail of what happens when
          display: flex is declared is defined in the CSS Flexible Box Model
          specification.

      <!-- position -->
      <div>
        <h1>Position</h1>
        <p>
          The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a
          document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the
          final location of positioned elements.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            static The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the
            document. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have
            no effect. This is the default value.
          </li>
          <li>
            relative The element is positioned according to the normal flow of
            the document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values
            of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the
            position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the
            element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.
            This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index
            is not auto. Its effect on table-*-group, table-row, table-column,
            table-cell, and table-caption elements is undefined.
          </li>
          <li>
            absolute The element is removed from the normal document flow, and
            no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is
            positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any;
            otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block.
            Its final position is determined by the values of top, right,
            bottom, and left. This value creates a new stacking context when the
            value of z-index is not auto. The margins of absolutely positioned
            boxes do not collapse with other margins.
          </li>
          <li>
            fixed The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no
            space is created for the element in the page layout. It is
            positioned relative to the initial containing block established by
            the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform,
            perspective, or filter property set to something other than none
            (see the CSS Transforms Spec), or the will-change property is set to
            transform, in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing
            block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective
            and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final
            position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and
            left. This value always creates a new stacking context. In printed
            documents, the element is placed in the same position on every page.
          </li>
          <li>
            sticky The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the
            document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor
            and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including
            table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom,
            and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other
            elements. This value always creates a new stacking context. Note
            that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a
            "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll,
            auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn't the nearest actually
            scrolling ancestor.
